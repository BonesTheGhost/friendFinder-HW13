Homework for express module.

NEW TECHNOLOGIES USED::
1. Express
2. Routing

CONCEPT::
    Essentially the whole point of this assignment seems to be an exercise in setting up the most basic of servers locally. 

    We then use our localhost to develop a series of pages and data files that are updated by paths and routing instead of simply
    using javascript or jquery for everything.

    Afterwards, the goal is to host it heroku in order to have a functioning website.

EXECUTION::
    I could not get this thing to work. I understand the concept, the routes make sense, but all of the data saving and updating stuff is gibberish to me.


*I have added pseudocode where I think the issues lie.
